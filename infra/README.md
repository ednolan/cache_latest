# Beman Project Infrastructure Repository

<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception -->

This repository contains the infrastructure for The Beman Project. This is NOT a library repository, so it does not
respect the usual structure of a Beman library repository nor The Beman Standard!

## Description

* `containers/`: Containers used for CI builds and tests in the Beman org.
* `tools/`: Tools used to manage the infrastructure and the codebase (e.g., linting, formatting, etc.).
